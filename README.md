---DIGITtally Backend---

Programs were designed by Maiken Skov and Dr. A Gillen, with the Dow-Davies Lab (University of Glasgow, 2024).


A series of programs which form the backend of www.digittally.org. These were designed to be run ONLY by the website - taking a large amount of user input data to define run conditions.

The Django framework for digittally.org calls DIGITtallyBackbone, which then runs other programs as appropriate to analyse various data sources for automated specificity meta-analysis
